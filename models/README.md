# Weather Temperature Predictor

This is a machine learning project that predicts the maximum temperature based on weather features using multiple models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest). It includes a Tkinter GUI for user input and predictions.

##  Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

## Files Included
- `weather.csv` — dataset
- `model_trainer.ipynb` — trains and saves models
- `gui_app.py` — GUI to select model and predict temp_max
- `.pkl` files — saved trained models (optional)
